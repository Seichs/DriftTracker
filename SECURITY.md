4. **Coordination**: We coordinate with reporters on disclosure timing
5. **Public Disclosure**: We publicly disclose the vulnerability and fix

## Security Considerations for DriftTracker

### Critical Areas

As a system used in search and rescue operations, the following areas are considered critical:

1. **Drift Calculation Accuracy**
   - Incorrect drift predictions could lead to failed rescue attempts
   - All mathematical calculations must be thoroughly validated
   - Coordinate transformations and distance calculations are critical

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Ocean current data must be validated and trusted
   - API responses must be verified for accuracy
   - Cached data must be properly managed

3. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Copernicus Marine API credentials must be secure
   - User sessions must be properly managed
   - Access to sensitive endpoints must be controlled

4. **Input Validation**
   - All coordinate inputs must be validated
   - Time and date inputs must be sanitized
   - Object type inputs must be verified

### Security Best Practices

#### For Contributors

1. **Never commit credentials** or sensitive data
2. **Validate all inputs** thoroughly
3. **Use parameterized queries** (when applicable)
4. **Follow the principle of least privilege**
5. **Keep dependencies updated**
6. **Run security scans** regularly

#### For Users

1. **Use strong passwords** for Copernicus Marine accounts
2. **Keep credentials secure** and never share them
3. **Validate predictions** against known data when possible
4. **Report suspicious behavior** immediately
5. **Use HTTPS** for all communications

### Security Testing

We regularly perform security testing:

- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning with Bandit
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular updates and vulnerability checks
- **Penetration Testing**: Periodic security assessments
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused code reviews for all changes

### Security Updates

Security updates are released as:

- **Critical**: Immediate release (same day)
- **High**: Within 7 days
- **Medium**: Within 30 days
- **Low**: Next regular release
